# Student Score Prediction

This project aims to predict students' final exam scores based on various factors such as study hours, attendance, previous scores, and other relevant features using regression models.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing of the student performance dataset
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Training and evaluation of Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression models
- Model performance evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and R² metrics
- Visualization of actual vs predicted exam scores
- Residual analysis to check prediction errors

## Dataset

The dataset used is **Student Performance Factors** from Kaggle:

[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors)
